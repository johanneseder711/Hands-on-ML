# Notes

## What is Machine Learning?
Programming computers so they can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 

## Why use Machine Learning?
__Machine Learning__ is great for
* turning existing solutions for problems to less code and better performance 
* complex problems
* adapt to new data
* lots of data

## Types of Machine Learning Systems
There are
* supervised vs. unsupervised
    * __supervised:__ classification, regression
    * __semi-supervised:__ usually a lot of unlabeled data and little label data
    * __unsupervised:__ cluster, visualization and dimensionally reduction, association rule learning, anamoly detection
    * __reinforcement learning__: The learningn system (aka agent) must learn by itself what is the best strategy (called policy) to get the most reward over time
* online vs. batch

* instance-based vs. model-based
